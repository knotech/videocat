# Silent Video Chat With Yourself

### Get video from webcam, and add effects.

Presently uses WebRTC (getUserMedia) functions which are not supported in all browsers, specifically Safari, and iOS just isn't about it at all. ('input file'? Isn't a file a stream in a sense? Can't we all just get along?)

Chrome is deprecating and changing a bunch of their implementation of it which is the only browser I've devd/tested it on, but this is just a POC for using p5 effects on webcam input.

### Features needed

1. First and foremost, I should learn how to use github's feature request feature to request features from myself.
2. WebSockets (or it's just a cartoon mirror).
3. Audio
4. Chat (Who doesn't like to read words on a screen?)
5. Clean up (I can't even remember which express-boilerplate I started this with.) 
6. MORE EFFECTS. SO MANY MORE EFFECTS.

### Run it

1. Download the zip and extract it to the dev folder (alternately clone it and `git remote remove origin`)
2. npm install
3. npm start
