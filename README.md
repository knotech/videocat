# Silent Video Chat With Yourself

This is just a POC for using p5 to affect webcam input.

### Get video from webcam, and add effects.

Presently uses WebRTC features which are not supported in all browsers, specifically Safari, and iOS.

Chrome is deprecating and changing a bunch of their implementation of it which is the only browser I've devd/tested it on, but this is just a POC for using p5 effects on webcam input.

### Features needed

1. First and foremost, I should learn how to use github's feature request feature to request features from myself.
2. WebSockets (or it's just a cartoon mirror).
3. Audio
4. Chat (Who doesn't like to read words on a screen?)
5. Clean up code.
6. More effects... SO MANY MORE EFFECTS.

### Run it

1. Download the zip and extract it to the dev folder (alternately clone it and `git remote remove origin`)
2. npm install
3. npm start
